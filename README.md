### **About our dataset**:

	• Used data collected from [Inside Airbnb] (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) for Chicago which is updated quarterly. Our pull was from March 19, 2023	
	
	        
 ### **About our project**:

	• Can we predict the future prices of Airbnb's across Chicago using location, property type, size of property,  past pricing, and various review types?
	• Want to get a feel for some great Chicago Airbnb's based on what future pricing is likely to be? Then check out our Data Model!

### **Restrictions**:
	• Pricing varies per day of the week as well as holidays and this type of data was not within our dataset, so we have to use other prediction factors outside of the realm of time

### **Languages Used**:
	• Pandas
	• Numpy
	

## **Preparing the Data**:

	1) ### **Cleaning**
		a. Transform data from gz to csv
		b. Remove entries not within Chicago
		c. Drop multitude of columns not relevent to our goal
		d. Ensure data types are appropriate and convert as needed
		e. Remove NaN values
    f. Streamline property types to be easier to navigate and appropriately combined![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84541056/231609547-7d460df7-c305-48e6-a50f-e43350b42c6f.png)
